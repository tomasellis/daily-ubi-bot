# Daily UBI Bot

A Twitter Bot that displays $ubi token info daily. https://twitter.com/daily_ubi_bot

# DISCLAIMER 1: This bot is made by @tomas_ellis0 on Twitter. The bot has nothing to do with the PoH people, its made by me, from the community to the community.

# DISCLAIMER 2: TheGraph currently displays PoH profiles information wrongly, and that's why I take into account both expired and registered profiles. [HIP-36](https://snapshot.org/#/poh.eth/proposal/0x4fad8883635c07280b2619521d1c5a408acd55f2548a50ddbbe16a6f627e319e) extended the expiration time for profiles, so as of 3/7/2022 no profiles can have the expired status. TheGraph still hasn't updated its numbers. Stick around for more info.

Feel free to open an issue with any suggestions.

I'll be writing a blog post sharing what I've learned building this bot soon.
